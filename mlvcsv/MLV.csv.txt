Let it not happen! 6:16 Do you* not know@ that to whom you* present yourselves <i>as</i> bondservants to obedience*@ you* are <i>the</i> bondservants to whom you* obey*; either of sin to death or of obedience* to righteousness? 6:17 But gratitude to God@ that@ <i>though</i> you* were bondservants of sin@ you* obeyed* from the heart to that pattern of teaching to which you* were given; 6:18 and having been made free from sin@ you* were enslaved to righteousness. <br> 6:19 I speak <i>in</i> human <i>terms</i> because of the weakness of your* flesh; for* as you* presented your* members <i>as</i> bondservants to uncleanness and to lawlessness <i>leading</i> to <i>more</i> lawlessness@ so now present your* members <i>as</i> bondservants to righteousness <i>leading</i> to sanctification. 6:20 For* when you* were bondservants of sin@ you* were free <i>in regard</i> to righteousness. 6:21 Therefore what fruit did you* have then in the things of which you* are now ashamed? For* the end of those things is death. 6:22 But now@ having been made free from sin and having been enslaved to God@ you* have your* fruit <i>leading</i> to sanctification and the end everlasting life. 6:23 For* the compensation of sin is death@ but the gift* of God is everlasting life in Christ Jesus our Lord. <br> <br> 7:1 Or are you* ignorant@ brethren (for* I am speaking to men who know the law)@ that the law has lordship over a man inasmuch time as he is living? 7:2 For* the woman in wedlock is bound by law to the living husband@ but if the husband dies@ she is <font color='#3366FF'> <font size=-1> <subscript> {F} </subscript> </font> </font> discharged from the law of the husband. 7:3 Then* consequently@ if while the husband is living@ she becomes <i>joined</i> to another man@ she will be divinely-called– an adulteress.

I <i>am</i> of Apollos! I <i>am</i> of Cephas! I <i>am</i> of Christ! <br> 1:13 Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified on your* behalf@ was he? Or were you* immersed* into the name of Paul? 1:14 I thank God that I immersed* none of you* except Crispus and Gaius; 1:15 that* no one might say that you* were immersed* into my name. 1:16 And I also immersed* the household of Stephanas; furthermore@ I do not know if I immersed* any other. 1:17 For* Christ sent me not to immerse*@ but to proclaim the good-news; not in wisdom of words@ (that* the cross of Christ might not be made void). <br> 1:18 For* the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing@ but to us who are being saved@ it is the power of God. 1:19 For* it has been written@ ‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will reject the understanding of the intelligent.' <font color='#3366FF'> <font size=-1> {Is. 29:14@ Ps. 33:10} </font> </font> 1:20 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish? 1:21 For* since@ in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God@ it delighted God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe. 1:22 Since Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom; 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified@ an offense to <i>the</i> Jews and foolishness to <i>the</i> Greeks; 1:24 but to those who are called@ both Jews and Greeks@ Christ <i>is</i> the power of God and the wisdom of God. 1:25 Because the foolish things of God are wiser than men@ and the weakness of God is mightier than men. <br> 1:26 For* you* see your calling brethren@ that not many are wise according to the flesh@ not many mighty@ not many noble. 1:27 But God chose the foolish things of the world@ that* he might shame the wise@ and God chose the weak things of the world@ that* he might shame the strong; 1:28 and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things that are scorned and the things that are not@ in order that he might do-away-with the things that are; 1:29 *that no flesh might boast before God. 1:30 But you* are from him@ in Christ Jesus@ who has become to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption from God; 1:31 that*@ as it has been written@ ‘He who boasts@ let him boast in the Lord.' <font color='#3366FF'> <font size=-1> {Jer. 9:24} </font> </font> <br> <br> 2:1 And brethren@ when I came to you* proclaiming the testimony of God to you*@ I did not come according to superiority of speech or of wisdom. 2:2 For* I decided not to know anything among you*@ except Jesus <i>the</i> Christ and him crucified. 2:3 And I was with you* in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. 2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom@ but in <i>the</i> demonstration of the Spirit and of power@ 2:5 in order that your* faith should not be in the wisdom of men@ but <i>be</i> in the power of God. <br> 2:6 Now we are speaking wisdom among those who are mature; yet a wisdom not of this age@ nor of the rulers of this age@ who are being done-away-with; 2:7 but we are speaking God's wisdom in a mystery@ the <i>wisdom</i> that has been hidden@ which God predetermined before the ages *for our glory. 2:8 <i>It is this mystery</i> which none of the rulers of this world has known; for* had they known it@ they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory; 2:9 but as it has been written@ ‘Things which <i>the</i> eye did not see and <i>the</i> ear did not hear and <i>things which</i> did not enter into the heart of man@ which God prepared for those who love* him.' <font color='#3366FF'> <font size=-1> {Is. 64:4} </font> </font> <br> 2:10 But God revealed <i>them</i> to us through his Spirit; for* the Spirit is searching all things@ even the depths of God. 2:11 For* who among men knows the things of a man@ except the spirit of the man@ which is in him? So also@ the things of God no one knows@ except the Spirit of God. 2:12 But we did not receive the spirit of the world@ but the <font color='#3366FF'> <font size=-1> <subscript> {F} </subscript> </font> </font> Spirit who is from God; that* we might know the things which were granted to us by God. 2:13 We also speak these things@ not in words which human wisdom is teaching@ but which the Holy Spirit is teaching; combining spiritual things with spiritual <i>words.</i> <br> 2:14 Now the physical man does not accept the things from the Spirit of God; for* they are foolishness to him@ and he cannot know them@ because they are spiritually examined. 2:15 But he who is spiritual is examining all things and he himself is examined by no one. 2:16 For* who has known the mind of the Lord@ who will lecture him?

Being reviled@ we speak well of <i>them</i>; being persecuted@ we are            tolerating <i>it</i>; 4:13 being blasphemed@ we are encouraging.

Should I come to you* with a rod or with love* and a spirit of meekness? <br> <br> 5:1 Fornication is heard literally <i>to be</i> among you* (and such fornication which is not even named among the Gentiles)@ that someone has his father's wife. 5:2 And you* are arrogant and did not rather mourn@ that* he who had done this work might be taken away out of your* midst. 5:3 For* indeed@ as being absent in body@ but being present in spirit@ I have already judged him thus who has worked this@ (as <i>though</i> I were present)@ 5:4 in the name of our Lord Jesus <i>the</i> Christ. When you* and my spirit are gathered together with the power of our Lord Jesus@ 5:5 to give such a one to the Adversary *for the utter-ruin of the flesh@ that* the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <br> 5:6 Your* boasting is not good. Do you* not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch? 5:7 Clean out the old leaven@ that* you* may be a new batch@ just-as you* are unleavened. For* Christ our Passover has also been sacrificed on our behalf. 5:8 So-then we should celebrate the festival@ not with old leaven@ nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness@ but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <br> 5:9 I have written to you* in my letter not to socialize with fornicators; 5:10 and certainly not <i>meaning</i> with the fornicators of this world or with the greedy and swindlers or with idolaters; otherwise@ you* are consequently* obligated to go forth out of the world. 5:11 But now@ I have written to you* not to socialize with anyone who is named a brother@ if <i>he is</i> either a fornicator or greedy or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an swindler; do not even eat with such <i>a person.</i> 5:12 For* what do I even have to do with judging those who are outside? Do you* not judge those who are inside? 5:13 But God will judge those who are outside and take away the evil man from <i>among</i> yourselves. <br> <br> 6:1 Do any of you* dare@ having a matter <i>of strife</i> toward the other@ go to court before the unrighteous and not before the holy-ones? 6:2 Or do you* not know that the holy-ones will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you*@ are you* unworthy of the smallest courts? 6:3 Do you* not know that we will judge <i>the</i> messengers? How much more the things <i>of</i> everyday life? 6:4 Therefore if you* indeed have courts <i>concerning</i> things of everyday life@ <i>why</i> are you* seating those who are scorned in the congregation* <i>as judges</i>? 6:5 I am saying <i>this</i> to shame you*. So is there not one wise <i>person</i> among you*? Not even one who will be able to judge between his brethren? 6:6 But brother is going to court with brother and that before unbelievers! 6:7 Therefore@ <i>it is</i> indeed already a literal loss among you* that you* have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather <i>just</i> be wronged? 6:8 No@ but you* yourselves do wrong and defraud and <i>you* do</i> these things <i>to</i> brethren. <br> 6:9 Or do you* not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators@ nor idolaters@ nor adulterers@ nor perverts@ nor homosexuals@ 6:10 nor the greedy@ nor thieves@ nor drunkards@ nor revilers@ nor swindlers@ will inherit the kingdom of God. 6:11 And some of you* were these@ but you* were bathed@ but you* were sanctified@ but you* were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God. <br> 6:12 All things are legal for me@ but not all things are advantageous. All things are legal for            me@ but I will not be brought under the authority by anything. 6:13 Foods <i>are</i> for            the belly and the belly <i>is</i> for foods@ but God will do-away-with both this and            these. But the body is not for fornication@ but for the Lord@ and the Lord for the body.            <br> 6:14 Now God both lifted up the Lord and will lift us up through his power. 6:15 Do you*            not know that your* bodies are members of Christ? Therefore should I take away the            members of Christ and make* them members of a harlot? Let it not happen! 6:16 Therefore            do you* not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For* he says@ The two            will become one flesh. <font color='#3366FF'> <font size=-1> {Gen. 2:24} </font> </font> 6:17 But            he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. 6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin@ whatever a            man practices@ <i>is</i> outside the body@ but he who fornicates sins toward his own            body. 6:19 Or do you* not know that your* body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in            you*@ whom you* have from God? And you* are not your* own; 6:20 for* you* were bought            with a price. Glorify God in your* body and in your spirit which is God's! <br> <br> 7:1            Now concerning the things of which you* wrote to me: <i>it is</i> good for a man not            to touch a woman <i>sexually.</i> 7:2 But@ because of fornications@ let each            <i>man</i> have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband. 7:3 Let the            husband give to the wife her owed benevolence and likewise also the wife to the            husband. 7:4 The wife does not have authority over her own body@ but the husband and            likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body@ but the wife. 7:5            Do not deprive one another@ lest it is from agreement for a season@ that* you* may            occupy yourselves with fasting and with prayer and you* may come together to the same            again@ in order that the Adversary may not tempt you* because of your* shortage of self-control. 7:6 But I am saying this by concession@ not by commandment. 7:7 For* I wish that            all men were even as I <i>am</i> myself. But each man has his own gift* from God@            one so and another thus. <br> 7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows@ it is good            for them if they remain even as I <i>am</i>. 7:9 But if they do not have self-control@            let them marry; for* it is better to marry than to be inflamed. 7:10 But I command to the            married@ (not I@ but the Lord)@ That the wife is not to be separated from her husband            7:11 (but even if she is separated@ she should remain unmarried or be reconciled to her            husband)@ and that the husband <i>is</i> not to leave his wife. <br> 7:12 But to the rest            I say@ (not the Lord); if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell            with him@ let him not leave her. 7:13 And <i>if</i> a wife who has an unbelieving            husband and he consents to dwell with her@ let her not leave her husband. 7:14 For* the            unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by            the husband. Consequently@ your* children were unclean@ but now they are holy. 7:15            Yet if the unbelieving <i>spouse</i> separates@ let him separate; the brother or the            sister is not enslaved in such. Now God has called us in peace. 7:16 For* O wife@ how do            you know if you will save your husband? Or O husband@ how do you know if you will            save your wife? <br> 7:17 Except as God has divided to each one@ as the Lord has called            each@ so let him walk. And so I command in all the congregations*. 7:18 Was anyone            called being circumcised? Let him not be uncircumcised. Has any been called in            uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. 7:19 Circumcision is nothing and            uncircumcision is nothing@ but the keeping of the commandments of God. 7:20 Let each            one remain in that calling in which he was called. 7:21 Were you called being a            bondservant? Let it not be a care to you@ but if you are also able to become free use            <i>it</i> rather. 7:22 For* he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant@ is the            Lord's freedman; likewise he who was called being free@ is Christ's bondservant. 7:23            You* were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. 7:24 Brethren@ let            each one@ in what he was called@ abide with God in that. <br> 7:25 Now concerning            virgins I have no commandment of the Lord@ but I give my viewpoint@ as one who has been shown-mercy by the Lord to be faithful. 7:26 Therefore I suppose this to be* good because of the present necessity that is upon us; that it is good for a man to be like he is. 7:27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 7:28 But even if you marry@ you have not sinned@ and if a virgin marries@ she has not sinned. Yet such will have affliction in the flesh and I <i>would</i> spare you*. <br> 7:29 But@ I say this@ brethren@ the time is limited@ that* henceforth both those who have wives may be as <i>though</i> they had none; 7:30 and those who weep@ as <i>though</i> they did not weep@ and those who rejoice@ as <i>though</i> they did not rejoice@ and those who buy@ as <i>though</i> they did not have; 7:31 and those who use this world@ as <i>though</i> they did not make full use of <i>it</i>; for* the fashion of this world is passing away. <br> 7:32 But I wish <i>for</i> you* to be carefree. He who is unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord@ how he will please the Lord; 7:33 but he who is married is anxious for the things of the world@ how he may please his wife. 7:34 He has been divided. The <i>unmarried</i> woman (also the virgin) is anxious for that which <i>is</i> of the Lord@ that* she may be holy both in body and in spirit@ but she who is married is anxious for the things of the world@ how she will please her husband. 7:35 And I say this is advantageous for yourselves*@ not that* I may cast a noose upon you*@ but *for what is decent and that you* may be devoted to the Lord without distraction. <br> 7:36 But if anyone supposes he is behaving improperly toward his virgin@ if she is beyond her prime and thus it ought to happen@ let him do what he wills; he is not sinning; let them marry. 7:37 But he who stands@ grounded in his heart@ having no necessity@ but has the authority concerning his own will and he has decided this in his own heart to keep his own virgin@ he does well. 7:38 So-then both he who betroths <i>his own virgin</i> does well@ and he who does not betroth <i>his own virgin</i> is doing better. <br> 7:39 A wife is bound by law inasmuch time as her husband is living@ but if the husband has fallen-asleep@ she is free to be married to whom she wills <i>@ but</i> only in the Lord. 7:40 But she is fortunate if she remains so@ according to my viewpoint and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. <br> <br> 8:1 Now concerning idol-sacrifices: we know that all have knowledge. Knowledge is arrogant@ but love* builds up. 8:2 But if anyone thinks to have known anything@ he has known nothing yet like he ought to know; 8:3 but if anyone loves* God@ this one is known by him. 8:4 Therefore concerning the food of idol-sacrifices@ we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God except one. 8:5 For* if indeed there are <i>so</i> called gods@ if in heaven or upon the earth; as there are many <i>such</i> gods and many <i>such</i> lords@ 8:6 but to us <i>there is</i> one God@ the Father@ from whom are all things and we <i>are</i> *for him@ and one Lord@ Jesus <i>the</i> Christ@ through whom are all things and we through him. 8:7 But that knowledge <i>is</i> not in all <i>people</i>@ but some until now@ with the consciousness of the idol@ eat <i>it</i> like an idol-sacrifice@ and their conscience is defiled@ being weak. 8:8 But food does not present us to God; for* neither@ if we eat@ do we abound?

Michael and his messengers            <i>going forth</i> to make war with the dragon@ and the dragon and his messengers            made war. 12:8 And they did not prevail@ neither was a place found for him any more in            heaven. 12:9 And the great dragon was cast down@ the ancient serpent@ who is called            the Devil and the Adversary@ the misleader of the whole inhabited-earth; he was cast            down to the earth and his messengers were cast down with him. 12:10 And I heard a great            voice in heaven@ saying@ Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our            God and the authority of his Christ has come@ because the accuser of our brethren is            cast down@ who is accusing them before our God day and night. 12:11 And they overcame            him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony@ and            they did not love* their life even to death. 12:12 Because of this@ be joyous@ O heavens and you* who are dwelling in them.

Here is the endurance and the faith of the holy-ones. <br> 13:11 And I saw another beast ascending out of the earth@ and he had two horns similar to a lamb and he spoke like a dragon. 13:12 And he practiced all the authority of the first beast in his sight and makes* the earth and those who are dwelling in it that* they should worship the first beast@ whose wound of death was healed. 13:13 And he does great signs@ even makes* fire in order that it might come down from heaven upon the earth in the sight of men. 13:14 And he is misleading those of mine who are dwelling upon the earth because of the signs which was given to him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to those who dwell upon the earth to make* an image to the beast@ who has the wound <i>of death</i> from the sword and lived. 13:15 And it was given to it to give breath to the image@ to the beast@ that* the image of the beast should speak and <i>that*</i> it should make* as many as would not worship the image of the beast <i>that*</i> they should be killed. 13:16 And he makes* all@ the little and the great@ and the rich and the poor. and the free and the bond@ in order that there may be marks given to them upon their right hand or upon their foreheads; 13:17 and that* no one may be able to buy or to sell@ except he who has the mark@ <i>which is</i> the name of the beast or the number of its name. 13:18 Here is wisdom.

And the voice which I heard            <i>was</i> like <i>that</i> of harpists harping with their harps. 14:3 And they are            singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders            and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand@ who had            been bought out of the earth. 14:4 These are those who were not defiled with women; for*            they are virgins. These are those who are following the Lamb wherever he goes. These            were bought by Jesus from among men@ <i>as</i> the first-fruits to God and to the            Lamb. 14:5 And no lie was found in their mouth. They are unblemished. <br> 14:6 And I saw            a messenger flying in mid-heaven@ having <i>the</i> everlasting good-news to            proclaim to those who dwell upon the earth and to every nation and tribe and language            and people; 14:7 and he says with a great voice@ Fear the Lord and give him glory@            because the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made* the heaven and            the earth and sea and springs of waters. <br> 14:8 And another@ a second messenger@            followed@ saying@ Fallen@ fallen is Babylon the great@ who has given all the nations            to drink out of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. <br> 14:9 And another            messenger@ a third@ followed them@ saying with a great voice@ If anyone is            worshiping the beast and his image and receives a mark upon his forehead or upon his            hand@ 14:10 he will also drink out of the wine of the wrath of God. <i>The wrath</i>            which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger@ and he will be tormented with fire            and brimstone before the holy messengers and before the Lamb; 14:11 and the smoke of            their torment is going up forever and ever@ and they have no rest day and night@ who            are worshiping the beast and his image and if anyone receives the mark of his name. 14:12            Here is the endurance of the holy-ones@ those who are keeping the commandments of            God and the faith of Jesus. <br> 14:13 And I heard the voice from heaven saying to me@            Write@ fortunate are the dead who die in the Lord from now.

This is the first resurrection. 20:6 Fortunate and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority@ but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him a thousand years. <br> 20:7 And when the thousand years might be finished@ the Adversary will be loosed out of his prison@ 20:8 and will go out to mislead the nations which are in the four corners of the earth@ Gog and Magog@ to gather them together into the war. The number of whom is like the sand of the sea. 20:9 And they went up over the width of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the holy-ones and the beloved city and fire from God came down out of heaven and devoured them. 20:10 And the Devil who is misleading them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone@ where the beast and the false prophet are also@ and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. <br> 20:11 And I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it@ from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away@ and no place was found for them. 20:12 And I saw the dead@ the great and the little@ standing before the throne@ and books were opened and another book was opened@ which is <i>the</i> Book of Life and the dead were judged out of the things which have been written in the books@ according to their works. 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it@ and death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them and they were judged everyone according to their works. 20:14 And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.
