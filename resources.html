                Basics of Biblical Greek<br><br>

 

Very Informative, great for someone with a heart for study and a passion for learning Biblical Greek.  Very instructive, you can’t go wrong with the BBG.  It offers insights that pertain to the lesson and add to the retention of information.  If you have had any exposure to Biblical Greek in the past, and are looking to refresh your knowledge, you may find a lot of the sidebars to be needless.  There is a lot of supporting material for this book available at an additional purchase, workbook, flash cards, audios, and videos.  Probably the best all-around choice for the first-timer.

Learn to Read New Testament Greek

 <br><br>

Lean and mean, right to the point, this book wastes no time or paper.  Perfect as a refresher and for a guided class, makes a great reference as well.  Not the best stand-alone learner, but works very well with other resources such as information found on the internet.  There is also a workbook available.  The Author also offers a DVD videos class set but I’ve not watched it myself.            </td>

Learn New Testament Greek

 <br><br>

This is a hand held walk through the Biblical Greek learning process.  I found to be elementary, which might be good, but lacks defined structure.  Great for the person that is thinking about learning Biblical Greek but has little time to commit.

The Elements of New Testament Greek

 <br><br>

Probably my favorite for reference and the intense learner.  This books builds up and gets you going from the get-go.  The progression is comfortable and well-structured making a great reference after you start reading Greek on your own.  If you have had previous exposure to Biblical Greek but lost some due to no use, this is a great refresher.  It also seems best suited for a guided class.  Does not hold your hand as much as others, but I tend to like that.  Audios are available for this book.            </td>

                Going Deeper With New Testament Greek
<br><br>
This book is amazing!  Well planed, well thought out.  I didn’t think much of this book when I ordered it.  I thought it would be a nice addition to my biblical Greek books.  I judged it by its title.  It is a self contained learner, “the” next step from intro into intermediate.  However, if you don’t know any Greek this is not a good starter.  It might be tempting to do but would frustrate where the basics are assumed.  But choose any introductory biblical Greek book to start with and you’re all set.  Here’s what I like about it:   
<br><br>
<li>You don’t need to run out and buy a Greek bible right away to practice, it has a good amount of starter material from the Greek New Testament and follows each portion with a good break down of the text.

<li>It has its own vocab so you don't “need” to carry around your starter Greek book to stay sharp. 

<li>It reviews some of what you already learned but delves deeper into those topics.  At the same time it doesn’t bore you with the same old stuff.  
<br><br>
I would summarize with this: “Learn to Read New Testament Greek” followed by this book are a great pair.  All you need from there are a Greek New Testament and maybe a BDAG lexicon, because there is no equivalent to it.

		Greek Grammer Beyond the Basics
<br><br>
                A great work!  This book is intended to be a follow up to the Basics of Biblical Greek.  It go deep and does it from page one.  It would not serve well as a starter.  If you have not read one of the Greek introductory books you should do that first.  I found this book to be very informative.  It came before "Going Deeper With New Testament Greek" and if you choose to buy it, you will learn all you need to dig on your own.

                This is an abridged version of the "Greek Grammer: Beyond Basics".  It is worth it's lesser price and it still good for learning.  It is lighter and less intimidating. But it is still not all that the Greek Grammer is.

                This Greek-English lexicon of 3rd edition, known as the BDAG, has no replacement.  It stands alone in it's class.  I originally bought a copy in 2008 for $103.95 on Amazon.  After some years I took a break from Greek studies and decided to sell it due to need of money.  I sold it to Amazon for $90.00.  It wasn't a year later I regreted the sale.  I replaced it with another for $125.00.  It is very thick with bible-thin pages and goes into great detail in each lexical definition.  It include many words used in early church writings, but does not cover words that appear only in the LXX Greek texts.

                This book is not a lexicon.  I would recommend it for the beginner of Greek study.  It takes each verse of the New Testament and highlights a subset of "key" words with definition.  I bought it before I bought the BDAG.  It offers the convenience of following verse order rather than alphabetical order, making for easy to follow word study.
