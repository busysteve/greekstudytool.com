{\plain \fs26 \f1\fs26 {\u169\'a9}}{\plain \fs24  Copyright 1999, 2014 by G. Allen Walker, Co-Editor, world wide restrictions as follows:\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 We are not here to make money and we will entertain requests for any items not listed below.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 1. Copyright was done to stop some publishing company from copyrighting the MLV and then \softline
stopping free distribution like what happened to Vine{\u8217\'92}s Dictionary and to make sure the actual text \softline
is not changed by anyone but us.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 2. When quoting the {\u8220\'93}Modern Literal Version{\u8221\'94} the quotes are to be noted by {\u8216\'91}Modern Literal \softline
Version{\u8217\'92} or {\u8216\'91}MLV{\u8217\'92}. Footnoting larger amounts is totally acceptable.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 3. This translation may be used in any Bible commentary, study module, tract, class book, similar \softline
study materials as long as noted according to the guidelines above and the Modern Literal Version{\u8217\'92}s \softline
part does not exceed 80% of the volume of the total project; so {\u8216\'91}have at it.{\u8217\'92} This basically means you \softline
can quote 5000 verses without permission. (Please contact us first, we might be able to help you \softline
speed your project along.)\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 4. After 80% you cannot ever sell the MLV! Including no handling or shipping fees! Please report \softline
any violations. {\u8216\'91}We want to be rich in money as well as Spirit.{\u8217\'92} (smile)\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 5. If you want to incorporate this version into computer software form, the answer for non resale \softline
(true non profit or give away) is YES but the request must be formal (paper trail). At any given time \softline
you sell your product, the MLV must be removed from the product. If you find any software or \softline
module that is not linked from our main web page, consider the files there as being altered, pirated \softline
or contains possibly spyware.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 6. The HTML version and search engine can be reproduced on other web sites but requires \softline
permission. (Too many OLD copies of the MLV are around and we would like to have those fixed.)\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par
}{\plain \fs24 7. Createspace.com (link below) is the current publisher of the Modern Literal Version printed \softline
edition and please whenever possible buy directly from them (more of your money stays in the \softline
USA.) List price is $9.39 for the 8.5" x 11", wide margin, Bold Letter Edition paperback. Volume \softline
discounts from the Christian Library about $6 each for 18+ sales includes shipping.\par
}{\plain \fs24 \par

}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The {\u8220\'93}Modern Literal Version{\u8221\'94} uses the Majority Text ({\u8220\'93}The New Testament in the Original Greek Byzantine Textform \softline
2005 Compiled and Arranged by Maurice A. Robinson and William Pierpont{\u8221\'94}).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Two distinct and opposite techniques are used in translating the New Testament from the Greek. The "Modern Literal \softline
Version" is the first type, a {\u8216\'91}literal' translation sometimes called {\u8216\'91}word-for-word' translation. The second and most \softline
common in the past 30 years is to paraphrase the Greek into English. These are: dynamic equivalence, free style, thought-for-thought , better than a word-for-word and so on.  We understand the value of paraphrases for those looking for a \softline
Bible that reads as easily as a newspaper, however we feel strongly about having a Bible without opinions of what was \softline
meant but instead faithfully reproduces the original Greek Bible into Modern English. One way to look at this is: if there \softline
was a court case with a particular document that was being used as evidence and this document was in a foreign language \softline
would a "thought-for-thought" translation be acceptable?  The {\u8216\'91}document' we are talking about here is the {\u8216\'91}Last Will and \softline
Testament' of our Lord Jesus & Savior. The goal of everyone who worked on the "Modern Literal Version" was to keep \softline
any form of commentary or paraphrase out of this translation as is humanly possible. The MLV is not sold for profit \softline
because there is no denomination or publishing company or foundation behind it. All Christian groups have had the \softline
opportunity to submit fixes or help. The only uninspired traditions kept in the MLV are: punctuation and capitalization; \softline
chapter and verse numbers; and book order.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 The Open Translation Bible:}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The Modern Literal Version Bible is considered {\u8216\'91}finished,{\u8217\'92} although it has been open for revision by anyone since 1998. \softline
Our utmost desire is to have a translation that has no errors and }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 we believe that the best way to produce an error-free \softline
translation is to keep it open to the public in the same manner as {\u8216\'91}open-source software{\u8217\'92} is to programmers. We have \softline
found no better way than our {\u8216\'91}open translation{\u8217\'92} idea in its 15 years to achieve this goal. }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Absolutely anyone in the world \softline
is able to contribute, for sure, the few million who have visited the Christian Library have had that opportunity. You, too, \softline
may make recommendations or help with the entire New Testament, with either Greek or English type proofreading. If \softline
the recommendations this next year warrant another update next year, we will do one }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 per year in printed form & Kindle. \softline
If they are simply 20 places that need corrected, we will provide a corrections list on the web site to update printed books. \softline
We plan to update free electronic versions periodically throughout the year if needed. The {\u8216\'91}cutting edge{\u8217\'92} update is always \softline
the }{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 BOLD}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Letter Edition PDF at http://www.ModernLiteralVersion.org/bibles/MLV/MLVBL.pdf \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 As far as we know, this 'open translation' idea is unique to the MLV and you are invited to participate in helping to make \softline
the MLV even better. There is even a Facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/MLVbible. }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 All who have \softline
helped, have contributed something to further the readability or accuracy of this translation or simply double checked \softline
all who have worked on this translation before them. It is time the Bible is back into the hands of every day Christians, \softline
not some big publishing company only out to make money. Any corrections please email to mlvbible (at) gmail (dot) \softline

}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 History:}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The {\u8216\'91}Modern Literal Version New Testament{\u8217\'92} came about because of a young Christian{\u8217\'92}s goal to find an accurate \softline
Modern English translation from which to study in 1987. The New American Standard contradicted itself in Matthew \softline
5:17 and Ephesians 2:15 for example. Almost all other Modern English translations do not claim to be literal or word-for-word and most that do are really not. Concordance look-ups showed the non-uniform Greek word renderings in all \softline
existing translations, this too became an  issue of concern.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 A group of Christians, of which this new Christian was a part, were actively doing topical, }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 English and Greek word \softline
studies with their Bibles and {\u8220\'93}Englishman{\u8217\'92}s Greek Concordances.{\u8221\'94} They discovered the ASV was the most accurate \softline
translation. They initially started a study bible cross reference section for it. }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Then an idea grew to do a computerized \softline
revision of the 1901 American Standard Version for the public domain, code named {\u8220\'93}ASV3{\u8221\'94}. These ideas were dropped \softline
with too many problems: the underlining Greek text, massive footnoting, archaic words, inconsistent Greek word \softline
translations, etc. A better idea grew, the creation of a modern (English) literal version (which later became the name). \softline
A group of workers, computer owners and scholars, who believe in the total authority and inspiration of the Bible, \softline
devoted time, advise, software and work for the project. Now, over 27 years later, at least 35 experts in the original \softline
language have contributed work needed to make this translation a reality. Many others, about 170, have also helped with \softline
large amounts of proofreading, English comprehension, double-checking Greek definitions, compounds, synonyms, \softline
Greek concordance look-ups, accuracy checks and/or other menial (but extremely essential) tasks. A few thousand \softline
corrections have been received via E-mail for changes, so far. We will never be able to express our gratitude enough to \softline
all of these people, living & dead.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The MLV was the first translation to use the power of the computer (8086) and would have been impossible before the \softline
computer age. This translation would have been impossible without Word Perfect (special thanks to Corel Corporation). \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 The original intentions and guidelines for the {\u8216\'91}Modern Literal Version{\u8217\'92} were:}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 1. To translate the original language, word-for-word into English. Then to further boost the accuracy of the MLV, to \softline
translate the same Greek word into as few different English words as possible. We also do this for English words by not \softline
using them for different Greek words. Careful attention was paid to synonyms, antonyms and compound words. One way \softline
to look at this is: if God wanted 10 different words used instead of one single Greek word, the inspired writers would \softline
have penned it that way. The New Testament is its own best commentary when you see the same Greek word translated \softline
into the same English word throughout. We call this {\u8216\'91}uniform and consistent' translating and we believe we're the first \softline
translation to ever attempt this. This form of translation is an extremely hard task, not one that many translators would \softline
ever take the time to do, even now that it is possible with computers. More information is in the {\u8216\'91}Wording Statistics' \softline
section later.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 2. The goal of the MLV was not to make it perfect everyday English, but try to make it understandable to the majority \softline
of English speaking people, while remaining literal. Sentences in the MLV may start with conjunctions like 'and,' 'but,' \softline
'for' and {\u8216\'91}because'. This was so we could split incredible long sentences (50+ words) that were appearing as we translated \softline
into English. The Modern Literal Version is about junior high school reading level.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 3. To translate some verses that have been misinterpreted for years by many religious groups, as close as possible to the \softline
original language.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 4. To use }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 italics }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 for supplied words and use supplied words as opposed to paraphrasing. We want people to see what we \softline
added.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 5. To translate the money and measuring systems of the Bible into some understandable form. (See the Appendix.) \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 6. To use {\u8216\'91}will' for all future tenses. Though it is not proper modern English. It is the way most English people speak. \softline
{\u8216\'91}Shall' is retained in questions.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 7. To use paragraph format. Verse format take meanings out of context.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 8. To use the more proper {\u8216\'91}may' or {\u8216\'91}might' for the subjunctive mood verbs. The ASV used {\u8216\'91}should' and {\u8216\'91}shall.' Shall is \softline
not consider {\u8216\'91}conditional' in modern English, but future tense. (See more in the Appendix II section).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 9. To arrange the Greek word order into normal English word order of subject verb object, (SVO). Following Greek word \softline
order is not more literal or accurate; if we retained the Greek order it would be more like an interlinear without the Greek.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 10. To footnote or explain in the Appendix places where a literal translation could not be understood or was an idiom \softline
used by the common Greeks. For example: {\u8216\'91}into/to the ages' is an idiom for {\u8216\'91}forever'. (These are not as common as many \softline
people would have you believe).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 11. To render active tense verbs as {\u8216\'91}is/are verb-ing' to help show action. Many people wrongly say the {\u8216\'91}-eth' ending used \softline
in older translations meant continual action. It was simply the way they spoke before the 1800's.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 12. To fix the preposition and conjunction problems that plague all translations. Our biggest fix is the English word {\u8216\'91}for' \softline
that was used even in the ASV for several Greek words which mean {\u8216\'91}because of,' {\u8216\'91}because,' {\u8216\'91}to,' {\u8216\'91} toward,' {\u8216\'91}of,' {\u8216\'91}in/on \softline
behalf of' and a mild form of {\u8216\'91}because.' The MLV translated all Greek words that mean {\u8216\'91}because,' {\u8216\'91}because of' and {\u8216\'91}in/on \softline
behalf of' as such. The other meanings are shown by use of asterisks (*) with the two most common Greek words \softline
translated as {\u8216\'91}for' ({\u8216\'91}eis', G1520 = *for and G1063 {\u8216\'91}gar' = for*).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 13. }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 To avoid inconsistencies caused by splitting up the translators and proofreaders into groups . A typical translation \softline
may have 100 plus people but by the time you split them into 25 or more committees the number of people in one \softline
particular book might be as little as 4 and those different groups can cause stylistic and translation variations. Those who \softline
volunteer with the MLV tend to work all the way through the New Testament, so in the MLV the total per book far \softline
exceeds any committee type translation.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 14. To include a Harmony of the New Testament with AD dates, which gives a person the ability to read the Bible the \softline
way is was written or in chronological order. (Start at Mark, then go to Acts.)\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The 1987-1999 version, roughly 95% completed, was formally U.S. copyrighted and placed into the {\u8216\'91}Christian Library{\u8217\'92} \softline
in June, 1999 at http://www.ChristianLibrary.org because of needed bandwidth and limited funds \softline
http://www.ModernLiteralVersion.org was added in 2014.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 A challenge to all who think that another translation is more accurate to the original Greek than the MLV. Show us the \softline
correction needed! Please remember {\u8216\'91}thus saith the Greek{\u8217\'92} not 'my version says.' This translation needs to be judged by \softline
the Greek, not anything else!\par

}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The primary goal is to keep the MLV free from theological concerns and traditions by translating as literally as possible \softline
while retaining modern language and readability. The {\u8216\'91}Open Translation{\u8217\'92} approach is also a great {\u8216\'91}checks & balance{\u8217\'92} \softline
system.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The Greeks wrote in present tense to give the reader the feeling of {\u8216\'91}being there{\u8217\'92} and so this translation leaves present \softline
tense unchanged.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Asterisks (*) are used for footnoting of words listed here in the Appendix.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  These are for the few instances where the \softline
English translation does not lend itself to a satisfactory meaning of the underlying Greek word. In addition to this, we \softline
also use an asterisk to denote the difference between one English word that is being used for two different Greek words \softline
(see }{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Age*}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  below.) This also aids word studies substantially.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 A hyphen (-) is used in those places where two English words come from one Greek word. It is of particular benefit to \softline
Greek scholars and the student who wishes, (when they are published), to cross-reference words to the MLV \softline
Concordance & Greek Lexicon.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Italicized words }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 are words not found directly in the Greek but are implied by the context. These words are sometimes \softline
needed to help show action, tense and to expand the meaning of some words that the English does not capture. Since the \softline
MLV is literal and not {\u8216\'91}thought-for-thought{\u8217\'92}, supplied words help greatly for those phrases which are exceptionally \softline
difficult to read. By signifying these words through italics the reader has the option to disregard them if they wish to do \softline
so. The articles {\u8216\'91}a{\u8217\'92} and {\u8216\'91}an{\u8217\'92} are not found in the Greek and so are always supplied though never marked.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Paragraphs are used in this translation with no credence given to chapter or verse numbers since verse formats, chapter \softline
titles or other special formatting often takes ideas out of context, (see Mark 8:34 to 9:1 for an example of this). Double \softline
spaced paragraphs was an attempt to arrange by subject. Single spaced paragraphs are for conversations or for sub-topics. \softline
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 We did not include subject headings as we felt this would only reflect our opinions and we do not want this in the Word \softline
of God.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Single or double quotation marks are not used in this translation because they are not found in the original language and \softline
adding them would be an area of opinion. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \cf3\fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 We also do not capitalize pronouns that appear to be referring to God ({\u8216\'91}Him,{\u8217\'92} {\u8216\'91}He{\u8217\'92} etc). This is again to avoid having \softline
our opinion in the translation as the Greek does not make these distinctions.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \cf3\fs20 Red Lettering}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  or }{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Bold Lettering}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  (electronic or printed edition) is used for the words of Jesus, God the Father and the \softline
Holy Spirit even in an indirect quote as in Acts 26. If you do not believe the }{\plain \fs20 \cf3\fs20 RED}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  or }{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 BOLD}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  should be used in a certain \softline
area, please ignore.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Greek is participle crazy. A rather large number of participles are found in Greek sentences and it is common that a \softline
sentence contains no main verb but just participle after participle. We have added in supplied words in an effort to stay \softline
more literal and yet break these into smaller more readable English sentences..\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The curly brackets (\{\}) offer additional information. They are blue in the Red Letter edition or gray in the Bold Letter \softline
release. These contain:\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab 1. The Old Testament reference at the end of the verse}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  which may be an exact quote or a paraphrase by the \softline
inspired writer or simply the location of the historical event. Single quotes are used at the beginning and end of the actual \softline
quotes or paraphrases of such. We did not try to translate the Greek in these Old Testament quotes to match the Hebrew \softline
to English translations.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab 2. We use {\u8216\'91}\{F\}{\u8217\'92} to represent footnotes to the left of the word}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 . The reader can find the footnote itself at the end \softline

{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Subjunctive Mood}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  verbs {\u8216\'91}}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 usually state a thing as conditional, possible (but not accomplished) or something merely \softline
entertained as a thought. It may be a statement viewed emotionally, as desired, doubted, or wished.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 {\u8217\'92} (Roberts \softline
Grammar, pg. 130.) Subjunctive mood verbs have always been a problem in translations in the past 600 years and \softline
have plagued the MLV as well. These verbs are denoted by the words {\u8216\'91}should, may or might{\u8217\'92} and are added in front \softline
of them. These subjunctive mood verbs in Greek are most often preceded by a {\u8216\'91}conditional particle{\u8217\'92} or some other \softline
part of speech (see G302, G1437, G1437a, G1875, G2579, G3752). These conditional statements, when translated \softline
into English, begin with words like {\u8216\'91}if, whoever, whatever, whenever{\u8217\'92} and the {\u8216\'91}should, may or might{\u8217\'92} is usually 
dropped, (too wordy and confusing for modern English). Some of these conditional statements are denoted at the \softline
beginning with {\u8216\'91}*that{\u8217\'92} (G3705), {\u8216\'91}that*{\u8217\'92} or {\u8216\'91}in order that{\u8217\'92}(G2443). We have translated all of these in places like Mark \softline
4:27 for the sake of remaining as literal as possible even though modern English would abbreviate the sentence down \softline
to only the first {\u8216\'91}should{\u8217\'92}.\par

{\plain \fs20 \fs20 In Greek translation, places where subjunctive mood verbs occur with G3661 are generally changed to imperative \softline
mood (this determined by context). An example of this is the ending of Mark 5:7 where the demon is speaking to \softline
Jesus and says: {\u8216\'91}Do not torment me{\u8217\'92} where subjunctive mood would be meaningless: {\u8216\'91}You may not torment me.{\u8217\'92} \softline
Even though a conditional statement does carry a future tense feeling, the improper use of {\u8216\'91}shall{\u8217\'92} and {\u8216\'91}will{\u8217\'92} was \softline
dropped. ({\u8216\'91}Shall{\u8217\'92} is Old English present tense of {\u8216\'91}should{\u8217\'92} as well as first person future tense; a current 13 year old \softline
has no idea about {\u8216\'91}shall{\u8217\'92} meaning {\u8216\'91}should.{\u8217\'92}) Even though, {\u8216\'91}may never{\u8217\'92} and {\u8216\'91}should we give?{\u8217\'92} might sound better as \softline
{\u8216\'91}will never{\u8217\'92} or {\u8216\'91}shall we give?{\u8217\'92} we opted to keep subjunctive mood as such as opposed to making them future tense. \softline

many significant translation principles:\line \line 1. It was the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 first}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  translation to use the power of modern computers. All the way back in 1987.\line 2. The MLV was the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 first}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  to attempt to keep Greek uniformity. (Same Greek word translation into the same English \softline

5:17 (abolish) vs. Eph 2:15 (abolish) one found in most modern translations; same English word used for 2 different \softline
Greek words. Jesus came to not tear down the old law but to fulfil it, and then abolished it with his dead on the cross and \softline
the 'New Covenant.'\line }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 5. The MLV was the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 first}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  bible translation to be open on the internet for anyone to submit corrections, updates or help, \softline

inconsistent translations. This means some books in the MLV may have had 40 or more people look over them for Greek \softline
